DEPI Java Track: Tasks, OOP & Design Patterns
Welcome to my dedicated GitHub repository for the DEPI Program's Java track! This repository is a central hub for all my coding exercises, problem-solving endeavors, and practical applications in Java, with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and various Design Patterns.

About This Repository
This repository documents my journey through the DEPI Program's Java curriculum. My aim is to:

Store and organize all my Java code, from basic syntax exercises to more complex projects.

Demonstrate understanding of core Java concepts, data structures, and algorithms.

Showcase proficiency in applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to solve real-world problems.

Implement and illustrate various Design Patterns to create robust, maintainable, and scalable Java applications.

Practice and apply software testing methodologies to ensure code quality and correctness.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into logical directories to make navigation easy. Here's a general overview:


Java Tasks
This section contains solutions to various Java programming tasks encountered during the DEPI program. This may include:

Basic syntax and control flow

Working with primitive data types and objects

Array and String manipulations

File I/O operations

Exception handling

Collections Framework exercises

Concurrency basics

And more...

Each task will typically reside in its own subdirectory with a clear name and a brief description in its README.md (if applicable) or as comments within the code.

OOP Problem Solving
Here you will find solutions to problems specifically designed to reinforce Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This includes practical examples and challenges related to:

Encapsulation: Hiding internal state and exposing controlled access.

Inheritance: Modeling "is-a" relationships and code reuse.

Polymorphism: Writing flexible code that can work with objects of different types.

Abstraction: Defining common interfaces and abstract classes.

Composition: Building complex objects from simpler ones ("has-a" relationships).

Interfaces: Defining contracts for behavior.

Each problem solution aims to demonstrate a clear application of these principles.

Design Patterns
This directory is dedicated to the implementation of various widely recognized Design Patterns in Java. Each pattern will have its own dedicated folder containing:

A clear example: Demonstrating how the pattern is applied.

Explanation: Comments within the code or a separate README.md explaining the pattern's purpose, structure, and benefits.

Use cases: Scenarios where the pattern is particularly useful.

You'll find implementations of patterns from the three main categories:

Creational Patterns: (e.g., Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)

Structural Patterns: (e.g., Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)

Behavioral Patterns: (e.g., Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor)

Software Testing
Given my enrollment in the Software Testing track, this section will house various examples and exercises related to ensuring code quality and correctness. This may include:

Unit Testing: Using frameworks like JUnit to test individual components or methods.

Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different modules.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): Examples of writing tests before writing the code.

Mocking and Stubbing: Using tools like Mockito for isolating dependencies during testing.

Code Coverage: Demonstrating understanding of test coverage metrics.
